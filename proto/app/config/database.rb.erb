# Database configuration file for Zen.
#
# This configuration file should contain all the required details to make it
# possible for Zen to connect to a SQL database.
#
# Keep in mind that it is recommended to add this file to your VCS' ignore list
# and instead only keep track of a default configuration file (e.g.
# database.default.rb). Doing this means your passwords and usernames don't end
# up being tracked by your VCS.
#
# The following items can be set:
#
# * adapter: the adapter to use. When using MySQL it's best to use the mysql2
#   gem as it's a lot faster than the mysql gem.
# * host: the hostname where the database is located.
# * username: the username to use for connecting to the database.
# * password: the password to use for connecting to the database.
# * database: the name of the database to use.
# * test: whether or not the connection should be verified.
# * encoding: the encoding type to use.
# * logger: the logger used for logging queries and such.
#
# Fore more information see the Sequel documentation:
# http://sequel.rubyforge.org/rdoc/files/doc/opening_databases_rdoc.html
